## Overview

The project utilizes a deep learning model to predict the likelihood of loan repayment success. It leverages TensorFlow and Keras for constructing the neural network, alongside Pandas for data manipulation and Scikit-learn for preprocessing steps.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have all the required libraries installed in your Python environment. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow pandas numpy scikit-learn
```

3. Download the dataset from the provided URL and place it in the project directory.

## Data Preparation

1. **Reading the Data:** The data is read from a CSV file into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Review and Processing:** Initial data review and preprocessing steps are conducted, including feature selection and target variable definition.
3. **Data Splitting:** The dataset is split into training and testing sets.
4. **Data Scaling:** Feature data is scaled using Scikit-learn's `StandardScaler`.

## Model Training and Evaluation

1. **Model Construction:** A deep neural network model is constructed using TensorFlow's Keras API, specifying layers, nodes, and activation functions.
2. **Model Training:** The model is compiled and trained on the scaled training dataset.
3. **Model Evaluation:** The trained model's performance is evaluated using the testing dataset to determine its loss and accuracy.

## Model Prediction

1. **Reload Model:** The saved model is reloaded for prediction purposes.
2. **Making Predictions:** Predictions are made on the testing dataset.
3. **Evaluation:** A classification report is generated to assess the model's prediction accuracy.

## Discussion on Recommendation System

This section discusses the data needed and approaches for building a recommendation system for student loans, including potential challenges and considerations for such a system.

### Data Collection

- Personal and financial information of students
- Academic data
- Loan product information

### Filtering Method

A combination of content-based and context-based filtering methods is proposed for matching students with suitable loan options.

### Real-world Challenges

- Keeping loan product information up-to-date
- Streamlining the loan application process in tandem with the recommendation system
